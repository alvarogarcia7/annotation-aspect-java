# Annotations and Aspects in java

## Installation

WARNING: This project uses the [java-parent](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/java-parent). There should be information on how to install it.

## Contents

The main objective is to annotate methods of a (production) object with the @TryCatch, so any declared exception (or its children) are logged on the @InjectedLogger (multiple) objects

## Quick start

Take a look at the tests and investigate around them. (The tests should be green :-) )
